\maketitle

\noindent In infectious disease systems, the transmission of certain viral diseases is governed by complex and dynamic interactions, which occur at different temporal as well as spatial scales. The dynamics constrained in only one scale have been widely studied. Typical models describing cellular level (i.e. within-host scale) and population level (i.e. between-host scale) systems have been well-developed and analysed. Nonetheless, it has been pointed out that, in infectious disease dynamics, within-host and between-host sub-systems can be connected, and their inter-relating property can provide researchers with deeper insights. In this project, we aim to build a bi-directional bridge which connects between-host and within-host sub-models. We will construct a multi-scale model by integrating these two sub-systems into a single framework via a wide range of coupling methods. Comprehensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis will also be performed.
